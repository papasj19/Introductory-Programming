## Overview

This program simulates a simple ATM with the following features:

1. **Deposit**  
   - Allows the user to deposit an amount into their account.  
   - Valid deposits must be greater than 0€ and up to 5000€.  

2. **Withdraw**  
   - Enables the user to withdraw funds from their account.  
   - The maximum withdrawal is 4000€ and cannot exceed two-thirds (2/3) of the user’s current balance.
